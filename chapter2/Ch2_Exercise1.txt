Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the end of the month, you review your expenses and sum up how much you spent.
So you have lots of inserts and a few reads. Should you use an array or list?

Answer: Linked List --> This is more efficient for inserts, because memory is not contiguous (not adjacent). Arrays are better for reads, Linked Lists are better for inserts/deletes.
    Back of the book: Above is correct, and since we're reading EVERY element in the list anyway, Linked List is also fine.
