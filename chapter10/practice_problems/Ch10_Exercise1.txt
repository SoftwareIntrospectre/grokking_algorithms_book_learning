"""
    You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture all over the country.
    You need to pack your truck with boxes.
    All the boxes are of different sizes, and you're trying to maximize the space you use in each truck.
    
    How would you pick boxes to maximize space?
    Come up with a greedy strategy.
    Will that give you the optimal solution?
"""

The greedy strategy is to use the largest boxes possible, but that would not be optimal.

I would do the "rock/pebbles/sand in a jar" strategy. I'd put in as many large boxes as I could, then the medium sized boxes where there are gaps,
then the smallest boxes where even smaller gaps exist.
