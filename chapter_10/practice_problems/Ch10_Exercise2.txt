"""
    You're going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything you can.
    You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) and estimate how long it takes.

    How can you maximize the point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your stay?
    Come up with a greedy strategy.
    Will that give you an optimal solution?
"""

The greedy strategy would be to go to the highest point values possible at each turn. No that would not be optimal.
