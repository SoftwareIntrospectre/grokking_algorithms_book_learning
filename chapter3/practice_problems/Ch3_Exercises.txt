Queston 1:

    Suppose I show you a call stack like this:

    ----------------
    |   Greet2     |
    |              |
    -----------------
    | Name:| Maggie |
    -----------------
    |   Greet       |
    |               |
    -----------------
    | Name:| Maggie |
    -----------------

    What information can you give me, based on this call stack?

Answer 1:

    Greet is the first item on the call stack. Name is defined as Maggie, and Greet2 uses this same value for Name as well.
    Greet2 will be popped off of the call stack first, with Greet being partially completed.

    The call stack stores the values of variables for multiple functions. Meaning, until the function that initialized the variable is done,
    that variable is saved in memory for the call stack.
        (Back of the book: Greet calls Greet2 with name = maggie. Greet suspends, and allows Greet2 to continue then pops off the call stack. Greet is now the highest on the call stack, and resumes until it's finishes.)
            This makes sense, because Greet calls Greet2 inside itself.
