Here's a small graph of my morning routine

             (Shower)
             /   
            v
    (Wake Up)
            ^
             \ 
             (Brush Teeth) <--- (Eat Breakfast)

It tells you that I can't eat brakfast until I've brushed my teeth. So "eat breakfast" DEPENDS ON "brush teeth".

On the other hand, showering doesn't depend on brushing my teeth because I can shower before I brush my teeth.
From this graph, you can make a list of the order in which I need to do my morning routine:

1. Wake Up
2. Shower
3. Brush Teeth
4. Eat Breakfast

Note that "Shower" can be moved around, so this list is also valid:

1. Wake Up
2. Brush Teeth
3. Shower
4. Eat Breakfast

Exercise 6.3: For these three lists, mark whether each one is valid or invalid

    A.
        1. Wake Up
        2. Shower
        3. Eat Breakfast
        4. Brush Teeth

    B.
        1. Wake Up
        2. Brush Teeth
        3. Eat Breakfast
        4. Shower

    C.
        1. Shower
        2. Wake Up
        3. Brush Teeth
        4. Eat Breakfast

Answer 6.3:
    A = Invalid (Eat Breakfast depends on Brush Teeth, so it can't be done first)
    B = Valid (Shower can be done any time after Wake Up, so this works.)
    C = invalid. (Shower depends on Wake Up, so it can't be first.)
        (Answered correctly)



Exercise 6.4: Here's a larger graph. Make a valid list for this graph.

             (Exercise) <--- (Shower) <--- (Get Dressed)
             /   
            v
    (Wake Up) <--- (Brush Teeth) <--- (Eat Breakfast)
            ^
             \ 
             (Pack Lunch)

            (Both answers are valid, but I prefer mine)
